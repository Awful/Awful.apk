    <section>
        <h2>3.6.0</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Now with leper's colony. Enjoy reading about why you were banned (hint: it's for posting badly)</li>
            <li>The icons have been updated. The frog is dead. Long live the frog.</li>
            <li>Don't like the frog? You can now change the app icon in the theme settings. There is also no longer a giant frog face when you open the app. Wait you've already seen that.</li>
            <li>Thread view overhaul. Sorry but your custom theme will probably break. Oops.</li>
            <li>Videos can go full-screen now. Oh the wonders of 2012 technology. Rotating your phone when a video is playing <i>might</i> make it full-screen. Can your phone do that? Find out today!</li>
            <li>Added link button to videos so you can send those bongocats to your mom. I bet this change-message will date horribly. Are bongocats fascist yet?</li>
            <li>Fixed instagram embeds breaking stuff they were not supposed to</li>
            <li>Also fixed Vimeo embeds for good measure. That's still a thing right? Vine? Hello?</li>
            <li>Oh and we do Soundcloud now as well. You're welcome.</li>
            <li>A lot of stuff under the hood. You should notice an especially significant improvement in threads with lots of pages. Contact your doctor if you don't</li>
            <li>Tuned the open/close thread options a bit. You'd need to be OP of a thread to use that though and science just isn't quite there yet.</li>
            <li>Fixed some issues when on probation. Still not a good idea, would not recommend.</li>
            <li>Changed up the default for some of the settings so be on your toes.</li>
            <li>Increased bitcoin mining efficiency to decrease battery drain. Ah I see you're still reading. Good for you!</li>
            <li>That changelog you've been reading? I guess that's new as well. It's a christmas miracle!</li>
        </ul>

            </li>
            <li>You can no longer disable hardware acceleration.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Fast fix for flickering frogs</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>3.2.5.0b</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Fix for crash when trying to view threads you have no permission to (e.g. accessing
                threads via bookmarks that are in the currently hidden GBS)
            </li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>3.2.5.0</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Added "Display Image" options to the image action menus (the stuff that pops up when
                you tap on images). Zoom away!
            </li>
            <li>Added basic PM notifications.</li>
            <li>Rearranged image action menu in the process because I kept downloading images. Also
                replaced icon for "Show inline image"
            </li>
            <li>If you have disabled gifs (as you should) tapping emoticons will now resume / pause
                their animation.
            </li>
            <li>Enhanced the post preview so more things work. Should now mostly behave like the app
                except for videos and youtube. But you hopefully won't want to watch them in a post
                preview. Right?
            </li>
            <li>Copied another thread tag from the iOS guys. If you see a thread tag that has not
                been remade yet you should visit their thread and tell them about it. If you post a
                proposal image, even better.
            </li>
            <li>Prevent attaching images with unsupported resolution or filetype.</li>
            <li>Attachments are now treated as images instead of links.</li>

        </ul>

            <li>New design for forum index icon. Please tell us in one of the threads (preferably
                the beta one in the project.log forum) whether or not you like it
            </li>
            <li>Post preview. Due to some very weird bug it only previews what the forums return, no
                stuff that needs javascript like webms and twitter embeds. Sorry.
            </li>
            <li>Bugfixes</li>

            <li>Ability to close and reopen threads</li>
            <li>Fixed crash on Xiaomi devices (caused by them overriding one of our libraries with a
                version from 2008 :argh:)
            </li>
            <li>Lots of work under the hood.</li>

            <li>Fixed a few crashes on older phones.</li>
            <li>Fixed a bug where the app would crash at the end of the probation period. If it's
                still crashing you'll need to clear the app data. Serves you right for posting badly
                tough
                :colbert:

            <li>New action menu for the post menu (Those three dots. No the other ones, the ones on
                every post). Much more customizable, no more reporting your own posts or marking
                yourself. Fix that removes the option to send PMs to non-plat users coming soon.

                update:
                No information is preloaded so they might take a bit longer to start. Imgur webms
                have a thumbnail to alleviate that. Quoted webms no longer autoplay.
