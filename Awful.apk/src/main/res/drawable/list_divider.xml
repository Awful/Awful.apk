        You probably don't want to use this!
        Pre-lollipop can't use ?attr references here, so you need to tint the drawable to theme it.
        Tinting in XML has issues, so it's better to just use a 1dp-high ImageView and set its
        background colour if you need a divider. This is only here so the Preferences divider can be set to something
    -->
